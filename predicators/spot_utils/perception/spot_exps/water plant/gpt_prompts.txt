# TASK DESCRIPTION

This is an environment configuration of objects and their xyz positions in the room.
Object LanguageID(plant pot) at position -- X: 2.049 Y: 0.186 Z: 0.424 rotation -- W: 1.0000 X: 0.0000 Y: 0.0000 Z: 0.0000
Object LanguageID(bin) at position -- X: 6.034 Y: -3.971 Z: -0.034 rotation -- W: 1.0000 X: 0.0000 Y: 0.0000 Z: 0.0000
Object LanguageID(watering can) at position -- X: 2.663 Y: -1.898 Z: 0.451 rotation -- W: 1.0000 X: 0.0000 Y: 0.0000 Z: 0.0000
Object LanguageID(wet towel) at position -- X: 2.327 Y: -0.800 Z: 0.375 rotation -- W: 1.0000 X: 0.0000 Y: 0.0000 Z: 0.0000

Goal: The agent is trying to water a plant in a plant pot.

The following is a successful trajectory (over 3 timesteps) the robot took in this environment (each trajectory contains xyz positions of the robot, along with the xyz positions and rotation quarternion of the robot's hand). 
Keep track of where the robot's positions and hand are relative to the other objects in the environment.

Successful trajectory:

Timestep 1:
Robot pose: position -- X: 4.033 Y: 0.259 Yaw: -170.4 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.747 Y: 0.006 Z: 0.350 rotation -- W: 0.7267 X: 0.0792 Y: 0.6823 Z: -0.0106

Timestep 2:
Robot pose: position -- X: 2.895 Y: -0.135 Yaw: -166.8 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.798 Y: 0.016 Z: 0.545 rotation -- W: 0.7673 X: 0.0040 Y: 0.6413 Z: 0.0063

Timestep 3:
Robot pose: position -- X: 2.895 Y: -0.135 Yaw: -166.8 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.798 Y: 0.016 Z: 0.545 rotation -- W: 0.7673 X: 0.0040 Y: 0.6413 Z: 0.0063

The following is an unsuccessful trajectory (over 3 timesteps) the robot took in this environment. 

Failed trajectory:

Timestep 1:
Robot pose: position -- X: 3.374 Y: -0.786 Yaw: -168.8 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.733 Y: 0.182 Z: 0.548 rotation -- W: 0.7644 X: 0.0012 Y: 0.6448 Z: 0.0016

Timestep 2:
Robot pose: position -- X: 2.917 Y: -0.209 Yaw: -166.4 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.799 Y: 0.028 Z: 0.444 rotation -- W: 0.7663 X: 0.0012 Y: 0.6420 Z: 0.0238

Timestep 3:
Timestep 3:
Robot pose: position -- X: 2.895 Y: -0.135 Yaw: -166.8 deg
Robot hand pose: position -- X: 0.798 Y: 0.016 Z: 0.445 rotation -- W: 0.7673 X: 0.0040 Y: 0.6413 Z: 0.0063

# ALGAE
Describe the key feature that distinguishes the successful trajectory from the failed trajectory.
Make sure the feature is semantically sensible for the goal. 
Reason step by step. 
Please specify a feature (only one feature e.g. if there are multiple possible explanations choose the most likely one). 
Makes sure the feature is computable from the state features in the scene (and no other information): plant_XYZ, robot_XYZ, robot_arm_XYZ, robot_arm_rotation. 
The feature can be relative positions to objects, relative positions to positions around objects (e.g. a force field around the object), relative positions to absolute points in space, relative rotations, etc. T
he feature can even be non-linear. However, make sure the feature is continuous and not discrete. 
Do not write the code to compute the feature, but do describe the feature in detail.

# LM-REWARD
Describe all the features that distinguish the successful trajectory from the failed trajectory.
Make sure the features are semantically sensible for the goal. 
Reason step by step.
Makes sure the features are computable from the state features in the scene (and no other information): plant_XYZ, robot_XYZ, robot_arm_XYZ, robot_arm_rotation. 
The features can be relative positions to objects, relative positions to positions around objects (e.g. a force field around the object), relative positions to absolute points in space, relative rotations, etc.
The features can even be non-linear. However, make sure the feature is continuous and not discrete. 
Do not write the code to compute the feature, but do describe the features in detail.
