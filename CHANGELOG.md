# Temp Changelog

## Mock Environment Testing Framework Development

### Initial Development
- Created initial mock environment for testing transition graphs
- Set up basic pick-and-place task with visualization
- Established test file at `tests/spot_utils/test_mock_env_transitions.py`

### Test Cases Development
1. Created three main test functions:
   - `test_single_block_pick_place()`: Basic pick-and-place with one block
   - `test_two_object_pick_place()`: Pick-and-place with two blocks
   - `test_view_reach_pick_place_two_objects()`: Full sequence including view, reach, pick, and place for two objects

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Added comprehensive docstrings for all tests
- Implemented rich logging configuration
- Created reset configuration fixture with planning parameters
- Set up proper predicate definitions and imports
- Organized visualization output in structured directories

### Major Fixes and Changes
- Fixed type issues:
  - Changed block type from `_container_type` to `_movable_object_type`
  - Corrected predicate type definitions
- Added missing imports:
  - Added pytest import
  - Added necessary predicates
- File organization:
  - Corrected output file paths
  - Structured output in `mock_env_data` directory
- Enhanced test functionality:
  - Added necessary predicates for proper planning
  - Structured test cases to show progression of complexity

### Current Structure
```
mock_env_data/
├── test_single_block_pick_place/
├── test_two_object_pick_place/
└── test_view_reach_pick_place_two/
```

### Test Features
1. Single Block Pick-and-Place:
   - Basic manipulation test
   - Tests core pick-and-place functionality
   - Verifies simple goal achievement

2. Two-Object Pick-and-Place:
   - Tests handling of multiple objects
   - Verifies more complex goal achievement
   - Tests interaction between objects

3. View-Reach-Pick-Place Sequence:
   - Tests full manipulation sequence
   - Includes viewing and reaching operations
   - Demonstrates complex action sequencing
   - Handles multiple objects with dependencies

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced type handling for objects
- More comprehensive initial states
- Clearer action sequences
- Better organized output structure
- More detailed documentation
- Proper error handling and assertions

### Documentation
- Added detailed docstrings for each test
- Included test case descriptions
- Documented output file locations
- Added configuration explanations
- Included predicate and atom descriptions

### Configuration
- Added rich logging setup
- Implemented reset configuration fixture
- Set up planning parameters:
  - Task planning heuristic
  - Maximum skeletons optimization
  - Necessary atoms usage
  - Expected atoms checking

### Future Work
- Consider adding more complex scenarios
- Potential for additional operator testing
- Possible expansion of visualization capabilities
- Consider adding more assertion checks
- Potential for parameterized testing
